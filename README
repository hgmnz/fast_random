fast_random
==========

This plugin extends active record by adding a class level random method which returns a random record from the database.

The approach taken performs better than 'order by rand() limit 1' for large datasets. It uses offset instead of an order by to retrieve the random record in a database agnostic way.

Example
=======

class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base; end

Foo.random
